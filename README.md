This is a project exploreing a interesting tech stack useing MongooDB express react node.js and graphql it is a social media site/blog 
dureing the course of this project i feel like i grew my knowledge on this entire stack greatly. However i think the most useful take away
was the power of graphql i look forword to implementing it in future projects
